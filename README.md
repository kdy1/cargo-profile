# cargo-profile

Profiling rust program made easy.

# Features

## flamegraph

Note: For now, it only supports `dtrace` on mac os x. If there are enough requests, I'll add support for perf on linux.

### Usage

```sh
# Just use cargo's syntax
cargo profile flamegraph bench --lib
# If you have a my_bench in benches directory, you can do
cargo profile flamegraph bench --bench my_bench
```

## bin-path

Binaries built by cargo have some random strings as a suffix, and it makes invoking files generated by cargo harder.
Here comes `cargo profile bin-path` to aid it.

### Usage

```sh
perf record `cargo profile bin-path bench --bench fixture`
```

## trace

Note: It **does not** support `dtrace` and `perf` yet. Same as above, I'll implement it if there's a need.

### xctrace

`xctrace` is a tool to profile applications on

#### Usage

```sh
cargo profile trace xctrace bench --lib

cargo profile trace xctrace bench --bench my_bench
```
